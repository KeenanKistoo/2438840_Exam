The purchasing coding-challenge was frustrating, but it was a lot more rewarding than just displaying data. It felt there was a starting point and an end point which I have not really experienced in the web dev space yet. '

From an eCommerce perspective, this is something that is present across all websites, and I do feel that for portfolio purposes, it would be a good addition. '

For example, depreciation was exhausting to calculate, I would like to create an education tool that shows the formulae and tips that I learned when I was doing accounting in high school. '

In some cases, I would have to agree with the majority, but I do think that people tend to look at the past with a lot more sympathy and not understand the current state of video games. '

        info: 'However, I would still like to create an interactive collage generator to align with this nostalgic emotion. The user selects their favourite cards over the FIFA and EAFC lifespan, and I will attempt to generate a collage where each image either floats into place, appears randomly or fades-in. The user will also be able to select their favourite FIFA or EAFC song. As the images appear in the collage, the chorus of the song will also play in background to contribute to the nostalgic feeling. '

        info: 'A lot of other games have fallen into this nostalgic patch where gamers appreciate the older content more than the current updates. For example, the Call of Duty community started petitions and went to events chanting that they would like an old map to be reintroduced to their game. The developers adhered to the request and the player count spiked post update however, after a few days the player count continued to drop. '

    {   type: 'text',
        info: 'Keeping this in mind, I would like EAFC to be the first instalment in these nostalgic flashbacks on the webapp. In future, I would like to create other collages and try to evoke this same emotion. I have selected EAFC because I have been actively present since I was six years old. I have lived through a lot of changes, both good and bad, and I do think I can achieve this better than any other game.'
