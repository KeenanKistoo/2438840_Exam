For example, Rafia Santana’s display of her charity concept and follow-through is in the same article as a ‘Spy Plane.’ This did not really help my confusion on what Net Art really is. "

I kept moving back to pure JS and using a for and while loops to try and display data. This is something that I am 100% sure that I can move away from comfortable considering the issues that I have had with it in the past. "

If I add the state as a dependency in a useEffect hook, and then console.log the state, it shows correctly.  "
